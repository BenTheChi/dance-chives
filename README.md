# Dance Chives - An event archive app for the street dance community
## Problem
The street and club dance community thrives as an event-driven subculture centered around high-energy competitions known as battles. Through the collective grassroots efforts of dancers and organizers, thousands of these battles take place across the globe each year, generating extensive footage. While most events are promoted, shared, and documented on social media, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube lack the structure to systematically organize dance events and their metadata in an accessible way. As a result, the culture remains fragmented online, leaving many talented dancers, event hosts, and creators without proper recognition.  

Thatâ€™s where **Dance Chives** comes in.

## Solution
**Dance Chives** is a web app archive designed to collect, display, and track dance event data. Our goal is to unify all metadata, media, and social connection through our site. Most of the data we need is sourced from Instagram and YouTube, so we are only displaying them as iFrames. We aim for **high SEO** and organic search to drive traffic.  This site is highly inspired by similar sites like bboy.org and breakkonnect.com.  However, we aim to focus more on the collection of videos, images, and social media posts for events.

## Tech Todos
- Setup CI/CD pipeline.
- Add testing.
- Deploy to Vercel.
- Keep hitting Neo4j Aura to keep the instance up.
- Look into Tanstack for client/server syncing.
  - Consider if Zustand is needed for client-side syncing or if cache revalidation is enough.
  - Since client-side changes are minimal and mostly server-synced, Tanstack seems ideal.
- More architecture discussions.
  - Might start a weekly session just for engineers to brainstorm architecture design.
- Any other tickets on the project board.
